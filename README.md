[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/eulerto/pgquarrel.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/eulerto/pgquarrel)

Introduction
============

**pgquarrel** is a program that compares [PostgreSQL](http://www.postgresql.org/) database schemas (DDL).

Given two database connections, it output a file that represent the difference between schemas. It means that if you run the output file into the *from* database, it'll have the same schema as the *to* database. The main use case is to deploy database changes into testing, staging or production environment.

**pgquarrel** does not rely on another tool (such as **pg\_dump**) instead it connects directly to PostgreSQL server, obtain meta data from catalog, compare objects and output the commands necessary to turn *from* database into *to* database.

It could work with different PostgreSQL versions. The generated file could not work as expected if the *to* PostgreSQL version is greater than *from* PostgreSQL version. That's because the tool could generate commands that does not exist in a prior PostgreSQL version.


It works with different operating systems. It was tested on Linux, FreeBSD, and Windows.

Installation
============

**pgquarrel** is distributed as a source package and can be downloaded at [GitHub](http://github.com/eulerto/pgquarrel). The installation steps depend on your operating system.

You can also keep up with the latest fixes and features cloning the Git repository.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/eulerto/pgquarrel.git
```

UNIX based Operating Systems
----------------------------

Before installing **pgquarrel**, you should have PostgreSQL 9.0+ installed (including the header files). If PostgreSQL is not in your search path add -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=/path/to/pgsql to the cmake command.

```
$ tar -zxf pgquarrel-0.3.0.tgz
$ cd pgquarrel-0.3.0
$ cmake .
$ make
```

Windows
-------

You should have CMake 2.8.11+ installed and MS Visual Studio (tested with 2017). Open CMake Gui. If PostgreSQL is not in your path add an entry CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH (e.g. C:/Program Files/PostgreSQL/10). Change CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX if you want to install in another directory. Click on 'Configure' and then 'Generate'. Open MS Visual Studio project (path is specified in CMake Gui), right-click on ALL_BUILD and 'Compile'. After that right-click on INSTALL and 'Deploy'.

Features
========

**pgquarrel** does not support all of the PostgreSQL objects. Also, **pgquarrel** does not manipulate data (i.e. DML).

Although **pgquarrel** does not support all PostgreSQL objects, it covers many of the use cases. In future releases, we expect to implement the TODO items to cover more cases. The main absences are:

* inheritance;
* roles.

Usage
=====

```
$ pgquarrel [OPTION]...
```

By default, the changes will be output to stdout and only some kind of objects will be compared (those whose default is true).

The following command-line options are provided (all are optional):

* `config (-c)`: configuration file that contains source and target connection information and kind of objects that will be compared.
* `file (-f)`: send output to file, - for stdout (default: stdout).
* `ignore-version: ignore version check. pgquarrel uses the reserved keywords provided by the postgres version that it was compiled in. Server version greater than the compiled one could not properly quote some keywords used as identifiers.
* `summary (-s)`: print a summary of changes.
* `single-transaction (-s)`: output changes as a single transaction.
* `temp-directory: use this directory as a temporary area ( default: /tmp).
* `verbose (-v)`: verbose mode.
* `source-dbname`: source database name.
* `source-host`: source host name.
* `source-port`: source port.
* `source-username`: source user name.
* `target-dbname`: target database name.
* `target-host`: target host name.
* `target-port`: target port.
* `target-username`: target user name.
* `help`: print help.
* `version`: print version.
* `aggregate`: aggregate comparision (default: false).
* `cast`: cast comparision (default: false).
* `collation`: collation comparision (default: false).
* `comment`: comment comparision (default: false).
* `conversion`: conversion comparision (default: false).
* `domain`: domain comparision (default: true).
* `event-trigger`: event trigger comparision (default: false).
* `extension`: extension comparision (default: false).
* `fdw`: foreign data wrapper comparision (default: false).
* `function`: function comparision (default: true).
* `index`: index comparision (default: true).
* `language`: language comparision (default: false).
* `materialized-view`: materialized view comparision (default: true).
* `operator`: operator comparision (default: false).
* `owner`: owner comparision (default: false).
* `privileges`: privileges comparision (default: false).
* `rule`: rule comparision (default: false).
* `schema`: schema comparision (default: true).
* `security-labels`: security labels comparision (default: false).
* `sequence`: sequence comparision (default: true).
* `statistics`: statistics comparision (default: false).
* `table`: table comparision (default: true).
* `text-search`: text search comparision (default: false).
* `trigger`: trigger comparision (default: true).
* `type`: type comparision (default: true).
* `view`: view comparision (default: true).

You can use a configuration file to store the desired options. The _general_ section specifies which kind of objects will be output. The _target_ and _source_ section options specifies connection options to both servers. Have in mind that any command-line option can override the configuration file option. The configuration file contains the following structure:

```
[general]
output = /tmp/diff.sql
temp-directory = /tmp
verbose = false
summary = false
comment = false
security-labels = false
owner = false
privileges = false
ignore-version = false
single-transaction = false

aggregate = false
cast = false
collation = false
conversion = false
domain = true
event-trigger = false
extension = false
fdw = false
function = true
index = true
language = false
materialized-view = true
operator = false
rule = false
schema = true
sequence = true
statistics = false
table = true
text-search = false
trigger = true
type = true
view = true

[target]
host = 10.27.0.8
port = 5432
dbname = quarrel1
user = bob

[source]
host = 10.8.0.10
port = 5432
dbname = quarrel2
user = alice
```

Regression Tests
================

```
$ # adjust test/run-test.sh
$ cd pgquarrel-0.3.0/test
$ # test using 10 on both clusters
$ ./run-test.sh 10 10 init
```
